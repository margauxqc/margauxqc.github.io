      This is an advertising concept for Swiss army knives.  I was going for more of a holiday theme and so I drew on some ideas from middle-of-the-century Swiss advertising posters.  The Saint Bernard seemed like a natural fit since it portrays rugged strength, friendliness and outdoor sportsmanship and survival skills.  It is naturally also an iconic Swiss dog.
